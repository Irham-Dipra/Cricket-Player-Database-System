This is my Level-I, Term-II project, where I developed a cricket player database system using the JavaFX library. The database is based on the Indian Premier League (IPL). The system allows users to log in as either a manager or a guest.

Guest users can search for players based on various criteria such as name, position, club and country, salary range, and more. The system also offers advanced features like finding players with the maximum age, height, or salary within a club.

Managers have additional privileges, such as accessing their club's player list, and they can buy or sell players to manage their team effectively.
